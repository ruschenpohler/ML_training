# I. Standard Regression Inference

## An Inference Problem

Given a set of predictors, we would like to predict an outcome: `\(\mathbb {E} \left[ y_{i} | x_{i} \right]\)`.

That is, what is `\(y_{i}\)` given `\(x_{i}\)`?

- Example: What impact does red meat `\(x_{i}\)` have on general health `\(y_{i}\)`?

### Practically, we have to:

.pull-left[

1. Link predictors to outcome (link fct)
1. Define best fit criteria (loss fct)
1. Maximize fit
]

.pull-right[

**Can we make &lt;br/&gt; sense of this &lt;br/&gt; graphically?**

## 1. Link Function

.pull-left[

Data on daily red meat consumption

`$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    x_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; x_{n,p} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]

.pull-right[

Data on daily measures of blood pressure

`$$Y = \begin{bmatrix} 
    y_{1,1} &amp; y_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    y_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; y_{n,k} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]

**Link fct**: What is the relationship that links meat consumption and blood pressure?

&lt;img src="Intro-ML_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

name: standard1

# I. Standard Regression Inference

In other words, we need a function that links meat consumption to blood pressure:

`$$\mathbb { E } \left[ y_{i} | x_{i} \right] = f \left( \eta _ { i } \right)$$`

Here, `\(\eta_{i}\)` is our model that predicts blood pressure.

For simplicity, let blood pressure be a linear fct of meat consumption:

.pull-left[

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

`\(\eta _ { i } = \alpha + x_{i} \beta\)`

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

But we still don't know **_what_ straight line best approximates the relationship**!

# I. Standard Regression Inference

## 2. Loss Function

Second, we need to define "best fit".

Equivalent to saying we need to minimize statistical loss `\(\ell ( \alpha , \beta )\)`.

Can we make sense of this graphically?

&lt;img src="Intro-ML_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
name: standard2a

# I. Standard Regression Inference

With quadratic loss fct `\(\ell(\alpha,\beta)\)` (as per "ordinary least squares"), we have:

`$$\ell(\alpha,\beta) = \sum_{i=1} ^ {n} \left( y_{i} - \eta_{i} \right)^{2}$$`
That is, we consider the squared distance between our model prediction `\(\eta_{i}\)` of blood pressure and real measures of blood pressure `\(y_{i}\)`.

Now, all we need is to find the **straight line that minimizes `\(\ell(\alpha,\beta)\)`**.

&lt;br/&gt;

Great, this works!


---
name: whyMLB

# II. Why Machine Learning?

## A) High Dimensionality and Sparcity


But what if we are not only interested in the effect of meat consumption?

**What if the set of predictors `\(p\)` is large**?

Potentially even: `\(p&gt;n\)`!

.pull-left[

`$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; x_{1,3} &amp;x_{1,4} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    x_{n&lt;p,1} &amp;        &amp;         &amp;    &amp; x_{n&lt;p,p_{large}} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]

.pull-right[

`$$Y = \begin{bmatrix} 
    y_{1,1} &amp; y_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    y_{n,1} &amp;          &amp; y_{n,p} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]

&lt;br/&gt;

We need ways to generate **sparse models** that predict well in **high-dimensional space** (~with many potential covariates).

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

## A) Goal of Machine Learning

**Construct a sparse model `\(\eta\)` from high-dimensional data**

Model `\(\eta_{i}\)` predicts label `\(Y_{i}\)` (=outcome) from a subset of features `\(X_{i}\)` (= predictors)

Features `\(X_{i}\)` need to be selected (or weighed) such that model `\(\eta\)` best generalizes to new data ("out of sample")

But: At the core, **still (out-of-sample) loss minimization**!


---
name: whatMLB

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

## B) Supervised vs. Unsupervised ML

### Supervised Machine Learning

Predicting a label (~outcome)
+ Minimizing some kind of prediction error

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Classify data 
+ Minimizing misclassification


- This presentation focusses on supervised ML.


---
name: whatMLC

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

## C) Penalized Regression

Open question: **How to deal with high dimensionality in data?**

Let's remember the loss fct: `\(\ell(\alpha,\beta)\)`

- However, now the set of potential predictors is too large!

To make the model less complex, we would like to select only the most important predictors.

Let's penalize model complexity:

`$$\min \left\{\ell(\alpha,\beta) + n \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} K_{j} \left (\beta_{j} \right) \right\}$$`

**Shrinkage**: `\(\lambda\)` governs the magnitude of penalty or shrinkage.

**Regularization**: `\(K_{j} \left( \beta_{j} \right)\)` is a cost fct that defines the penalty regime


---
name: whatMLD1

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

### Types of cost fcts

&lt;img src="Intro-ML_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Take-away: Different ways of penalizing model complexity.

&lt;br/&gt;

But **__how much__ do we want to penalize complexity**? 

That is, how to choose `\(\lambda\)`? In other words, how do we validate a chosen `\(\lambda\)`?

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

### 1. Training and Test Sample

.pull-left[

`$$X_{train} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    x_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; x_{n,p} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
    
`$$X_{test} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    x_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; x_{n,p} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]


.pull-right[

`$$Y_{train} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    y_{1,1} &amp; y_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    y_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; y_{n,k} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
    
`$$?_{test} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    ?_{1,1} &amp; ?_{1,2} &amp; \dots \\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
    ?_{n,1} &amp;        &amp; ?_{n,k} 
    \end{bmatrix}$$`
]

### 2. `\(k\)`-fold cross-validation

Same principle as training-test sample split (details in [Additional Slides](#extras2))


### 3. Leave-one-out cross-validation

Split sample in **as many sub-samples as there are observations**


---
name: whatMLD

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?


## D) More Complex ML Algorithms

* **Regression Trees**

  + Iterative splits
  + Pools observations into orthogonal sub-spaces over features
  + Based on similarity in the label
  + Criteria e.g. Gini

* **Random Forests**

  + Ensemble of regression trees that imposes randomness across trees

* **Gradient Boosted Trees**

  + Ensemble of regression trees that are iteratively fit to previous trees' residuals


---
name: whatMLE

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

## Take-away

&lt;br/&gt;

Central issue: In **high-dimensional environments**, we need to find ways to come up with **sparse models** that predict outcomes well **out of sample**.

* One way is to **penalize model complexity** as a part of the loss fct `\(\ell(\alpha,\beta)\)`.

* That is, we incorporate a **shrinkage** parameter `\(\lambda\)` and a **cost fct** `\(K_{j} \left (\beta_{j} \right)\)`.

* **Regularization** is the process of shrinking and selecting some parameters, but not others.

* **Cross-validation** techniques are a way to set `\(\lambda\)` such that our model `\(\eta\)` best predicts out of sample.

* We call this data the **test sample**, and data the model is fitted on the **training data**.




---
name: whatMLE2

# III. What is the Intuition behind ML?

* **Neural Nets**

  + Inter-connected nodes organized into layers (~structure of the brain)
  + Signal passes through nodes which perform non-linear transformation on signal
  + Resulting prediction is highly flexible
  + Black box

### Covariate Selection through Regularization (Belloni et al., ReStud 2014)

Paper: “_Inference on Treatment Effects after Selection among High-Dimensional Controls_”

* Scenario: Experimental study, high-dimensional data with `\(p&gt;n\)`
* Goal: Select set of predictors `\(p_{small}&lt;n\)`

“**Double-selection procedure**”:
1. Use LASSO to select set of predictors for ..
  + .. outcome `\(y_{i}\)`
  + .. treatment assignment `\(d_{i}\)`
1. Choose predictors in the union of sets as control variables

* Similar literature: 
  + Instrumental variables estimation (e.g., Spiess, 2017; Hartford et al., 2017)

# IV. Where can ML be Put to Use?

## D) Hetereogeneity

### Predicting Treatment Heterogeneity

Papers:
  + Athey and Imbens(PNAS 2016) "_Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects_"
  + Wagner and Athey (JASA 2017) "_Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests_"
  + Davis and Heller (AER 2017) "_Using Causal Forests to Predict Treatment Heterogeneity_"
  
* Random trees and random forests to select covariates to use for heterogeneous treatment estimation


---

name: whereML5

# IV. Where can ML be Put to Use?

## E) Pre-analysis Plans

### Analytical Choices Guided by ML (Ludwig et al., AEAPP 2019)

Paper: "Augmenting Pre-analysis Plans with Machine Learning"

* **Specificity conundrum**: Theory often speaks little to specific choices which PAPs require to prevent data mining (e.g. data aggregation, sub-groups, controls, fct forms)

* **Standard PAP**: Fully specifies entire set of analytical choices
* **Pure ML PAP**:  Start with set of variables and make choices according to prediction problem
* **Augmented PAP**: Take the best of both worlds

Advantages:
1. Benefits from ML flexibility with, at most, limited costs in power
1. Limits the need of researchers to make arbitrary analytical choices
1. Integrates ex-post analysis without risking p-hacking

### Two sides to this argument

Especially for more complex ML algorithms:
 
1. **Opaque process**
  + De-bugging difficult
    
1. **Prediction without regard of DGP**
  + Intelligibility?
  + External validity?
  + Fairness?
  + Trust?

### Many Researcher Degrees of Freedom

* Data pre-processing
  + Example: Text analysis (tokens, n-grams, libraries, etc.)
* ML algorithm
* Regularization parameters
* Cross-validation methods/parameters
* Etc.

name: caveats4a

# V. What Caveats Apply?

Model complexity has obvious implication for research transparency (and, by extension, reproducibility)
  + ML algorithms may lend themselves to PAPs (see, [Augmented PAPs](#whereML5)) ..
  + .. but **actual practice is a complicated social equilibrium** (incentivization, social norms, tipping points, etc.) 

Potential solution: **Graphical representations**, such as DAGs (Pearl, 1995)
  + Encosing causal assumptions
  + Testability detection

## Minimizing Statistical Loss

Minimize empirical risk over space of functions (e.g., linear function, quadratic loss, neural networks, etc.):

`\begin{equation}
f ^ {*} = \arg \min_{f \in \mathcal {H}} \frac {1} {n} \sum L \left( f \left( x_{i} \right) , y_{i} \right)
\label{minloss}
\end{equation}`

Practical steps:
1. Choose type of loss function, e.g. quadratic `\(\left( f \left( x_{i} \right) - y_{i} \right) ^ {2}\)`
1. Choose starting point
1. Use Stochastic Gradient Descent to find minimum in iterative process

# Additional Slides

## `\(k\)`-fold cross-validation

&lt;br/&gt;

1. Split data into `\(k\)` sub-samples ("folds")
1. Repeatedly fit model `\(\eta\)` on all but current fold
1. Obtain fitted values of `\(y_{i}\)` for current fold
1. Iteratively cycle through all folds to obtain outcome index of fitted values of `\(y_{i}\)` for all observations
